This folder contains python scripts to simulate various quantum phase estimation (QPE) protocols using qiskit. Each script contains methods to run the protocol at the abstract "algorithmic" level (with arbitrary gates) or at an epsilion less abstract level with a noise model and where the circuits are compilied into the Clifford+T gate set making use of the CliffordTCompiler. An attempt was made to make the protocols in general, however, they were built specifically with the 3-qubit problem of H2 ground state energy estimation in mind and have not been rigorously tested on other problems.
