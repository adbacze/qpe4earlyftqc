This directory provides the requiste imports to simulate qpe protocols and get T counts and error from simulations.
The file Imports imports most of the packages/methods needed, including access to the Clifford+T compiler.
Subdirectory CliffordTCompiler contains the compiler that takes arbitrary QuantumCircuits and return the equivalent Clifford+T circuit.
Likewise, qpe_protocols contains the methods to simulate the phase estimaton protocols.
