# qpe4earlyftqc
This is part of a project to evaluate resource requirements of quantum phase estimation (qpe) protocols in an early fault tolerant setting. Files inculde scripts to run various
qpe protocols using IBMs qiskit package, along with a "Clifford+T Compilier" with takes a quantum circuit and synthesizes it into the universal gate set of Cliffords + Ts.
