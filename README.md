# qpe4earlyftqc
This is part of a project to evaluate resource requirements of quantum phase estimation (qpe) protocols in an early fault tolerant setting. 
Files inculde scripts to run various qpe protocols using IBMs qiskit package, along with a "Clifford+T Compilier" with takes a quantum circuit and synthesizes it into the universal gate set of Cliffords + Ts.
Additionally, scripts included in subdirectories H2_simulations and bi


Files are structured such that scripts should be run from parent directory (e.g. to run "H2ipe.py" either run as "$py ./H2_simulations/H2ipe" ot first move the script into parent directory)
